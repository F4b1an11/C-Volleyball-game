Here are some of the tutorials I have used to help develop this game. 

First is a sfml 3.0 [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lftcRWAIycg&list=PLz6j8tWRKzOHQPOL5gGY4Ev6DoMRB2gee&index=1)
This source has been great for getting a feel of the basics of the library.

Second is C++ game [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luuyjjOxnUI&list=PL7Ej6SUky135IAAR3PFCFyiVwanauRqj3&index=1)
This source does not use the sfml library but shows a lot of helpfull ways to incorprate game mechanics
such as game physics, collisions, window resize ect.. 

SFML [Documentation] 3.0 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/3.0.0/index.html)
Best way to understand the library.
